2008全球经济衰退导致中国的新毕业生的就业市场显著下降。 
2009年毕业的学生将加入到2008年毕业仍在找工作的300万学生之中。
毕业生过剩也可以归因于大学入学率的提高和教育机构的增加。
虽然大学的学生人数增加了，但是他们的质量并没有明显地提高。
在大多数情况下，毕业生无法在2008年找到合适的就业机会是因为他们没有行业所需的技能。

　　The 2008 global recession resulted in a significant drop in the job market for China’s new graduates. Students graduating in 2009 will join around three million students who graduated in 2008 and are still seeking job opportunities. The graduate glut can also be attributed to a rise in the number of college enrollments and educational institutions. Although the number of college students has increased, there has not been any significant improvement in their quality. In most cases, graduates were unable to find suitable employment in 2008 because they did not have the skills required by the industry.
