(potential strategies in the parentheses)

1. Verb: VA, VC, VE, VV 
  * Predicative adjective: VA  (insert copula)
  * Copula: VC  (translated as "be" in the main clause, how about embedded clauses?)
  * you3 as the main verb: VE  (=> most of the time, "have"; potentially expletive "there be") 
  * Other verb: VV  (postprocessing: tense & agreement)

2. Noun: NR, NT, NN 
  * Proper Noun: NR (direct translation; may need to check case or be turned to an adjective)  
  * Temporal Noun: NT (similar to localizer, move to either the beginning or the end, post-check preposition)
  * Other Noun: NN (post-check determiner, number, etc) 

3. Localizer: LC (move to either the beginning or the end of the sentence, post-check preposition)

4. Pronoun: PN (post-check case)

5 Determiners and numbers: DT, CD, OD 
  * Determiner: DT (just make sure no incompatible determiners in English in the end)
  * Cardinal Number: CD 
  * Ordinal Number: OD 
6 Measure word: M (when to delete them?) 

7 Adverb: AD (confusion with adjectives, reorder if necessary)

8 Preposition: P (might be better to check later)

9 Conjunctions: CC, CS 
  * Coordinating conjunction: CC 
  * Subordinating conjunction: CS  (move to the beginning of the clause if necessary?) 

10 Particle: DEC, DEG, DER, DEV, AS, SP, ETC, MSP . . . . . . 
  * de5 as a complementizer or a nominalizer: DEC (!to relative clause)
  * de5 as a genitive marker and an associative marker: DEG (to possessive; check case, genitive alternation) 
  * Resultative de5: DER 
  * Manner de5: DEV  (adverbial)
  * Aspect Particle: AS (-ing, PFV)
  * Sentence- nal particle: SP  (PFV, Question)
  * ETC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
